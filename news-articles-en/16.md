# AMENDMENTS TO THE WASTE MANAGEMENT ACT

The following are some of the most important novelties in the Waste Management Act, in force as of May 7, 2023.

### Responsibility of the waste generator

In the event of a change in technology, a change in the origin of the raw material and other activities that would affect the change in the character of the waste, the waste generator is required to obtain a waste study report. After the new changes, the report is kept for **five years**, after which the **waste generator is obliged to obtain a new waste study report**.  

The requirement for a waste generator to obtain a permit for the temporary storage of his own waste generated in the course of his main business activity in the place where the waste was generated has been abolished. On the other hand, a **waste generator who generates waste at several locations** and temporarily stores it in his central warehouse must obtain a permit for waste storage, and the warehouse must meet all the prescribed technical conditions. In this case, the waste may not be temporarily stored at the site of the generator, owner and/or other holder of the waste for more than **36 months**, after which the waste must be sent for treatment, i.e. reuse or disposal.  

### Waste treatment

The term mobile waste management facility is defined in more detail. In addition to the obligation to obtain a permit, consent or document for the treatment of waste in a mobile facility in accordance with the law and other regulations, there is also an obligation to **obtain the consent of the local self-government unit** on whose territory the waste treatment is carried out in the mobile facility, with the competent authority first obtaining information on the place where the waste treatment is carried out.

Another novelty is that the treatment of hazardous waste can only be carried out in a mobile facility for the operation of which **a notice of approval for an environmental impact assessment** has been issued in accordance with a special ordinance.

### Management of construction and demolition waste and sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants

The amendments to the Act require the separation of construction and demolition waste at the point of generation in order to prepare it for treatment, i.e. reuse, including the procedures of burial and backfilling and/or disposal, and the uncontrolled disposal of construction and demolition waste is prohibited.

A person who collects, transports, stores, treats, or reuses or disposes of construction and demolition waste is required to **keep records of the amount and type of construction and demolition waste it manages** and to submit the data to **the Environmental Protection Agency**.

The management of sewage sludge generated by municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants and other similar wastewater treatment facilities is regulated, and the generator and owner and/or other holder is required to treat the sewage sludge in accordance with regulations and to **keep records** of the amount of sewage sludge collected, stored, treated, or disposed of, and **to report** to the Environmental Protection Agency.

### Waste management permit and certificate of exemption from the permit requirement

Authority for issuance of waste management permits has been clarified to eliminate deficiencies observed in practice, and cases have been established where, instead of a permit, a **certificate of exemption from the permit requirement** is required. The certificate is issued for a period not **exceeding 90 days** (and it may not be reissued), in the case of:

1. tests carried out to determine technical and technological treatments in order to obtain data for the purpose of implementing the procedure for the preparation of an impact assessment study and/or equipment testing;
1. use of waste for scientific research purposes;
1. testing that is carried out to determine the technical and technological parameters of the reuse of waste in order to obtain data for the implementation of the procedure for the preparation of an impact assessment study;
1. disposal of one's own non-hazardous waste to the waste generator at the point of waste generation, except for waste generated by waste treatment processes.

Cases when neither a waste management permit nor a certificate of exemption from the permit requirement, is required are the following:

1. movement of waste within the location of the waste generator;
1. waste collection in containers or other household waste collection equipment,
1. temporary storage of the generator's own waste.

The conditions for issuing a waste management permit have been tightened to require, in addition to the existing requirements, a **certificate of non-conviction** of entrepreneurs, shareholders or representatives of legal entities for criminal offenses against the environment.
The obligation of the operator to submit an application to amend the permit is required if there is a change in the type and/or quantity of waste in the permit, the qualified person responsible for the professional work in waste management, the address of the registered office, the company name, the working hours or other data related to the equipment and operation of the facility change, as well as in case of changes in the data from the waste collection and/or transport permit, changes in the waste collection equipment, waste transport vehicles, types of waste, company name, legal form, address of the registered office, etc.

### Transboundary waste shipments

A permit from the Ministry of Environmental Protection is required for transboundary waste shipments: 
+ **permit for import, export and transit of waste** - for transboundary movements of hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste for which the issuance of a permit is foreseen, i.e. 
+ **confirmation of the application for transboundary movement of waste** - for waste included in the list of non-hazardous waste for which a permit is not issued, and which can be issued with a validity period not exceeding one year.

For wastes with the same physical and chemical properties that are shipped in multiple shipments to the same destination through the same border crossings, the import, export, and transit of wastes shall be authorised for a period of up to **12 months**, while transboundary shipments of hazardous wastes subject to notification shall be authorised for up to **36 months**.

Requiring exporters and importers to submit waste export and import data for the previous year to the Ministry by **March 31** of the current year is also mandatory.

### Deadline for harmonization

Both legal entities and individuals are required to bring their activities into compliance with the provisions of this Act within one year of its entry into force, i.e. by May 7, 2024.
