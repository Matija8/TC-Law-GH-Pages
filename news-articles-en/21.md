# LAW ON FOREIGNERS: WHAT AWAITS FOREIGN CITIZENS FROM 01.02.2024?

The Amendments to the Foreigners Act[^1] entered into force at the beginning of August last year, which were adopted i.a. with the objective to simplify the procedure regulating the stay of foreign citizens on the territory of the Republic of Serbia.

The implementation of a significant number of the provisions of the aforementioned statute was postponed until February 1, 2024, and a period of almost six months was allowed for adoption of regulations expected to regulate certain issues in more detail. However, even that was not enough to abide by *vacation legis* rule, so the purpose of publication of regulations was suspended in this case as well: the new regulations were only published on January 26 this year and entered into force already on February 1. Since only a few still care about constitutionality (and even less about *our* right to be acquainted with the norms that apply to *us*, we leave that debate to legal jurisprudence, and restrain to an overview of some of the novelties below. 

## **Foreigners subjected to the visa regime**

A visa, i.e. an approval to entry, stay or transit that a foreigner obtains before entering the territory of the Republic of Serbia, was until now issued in the form of a sticker that is stamped into the foreigner's travel document, and from February 1, 2024, it will also be issued in electronic format.

A long-stay visa (visa D) is an approval to enter and stay in the Republic of Serbia for a period of 90 to 180 days, and it is obtained by a foreigner who needs a visa to enter the Republic of Serbia in accordance with the visa regime and who intends to submit a request for a temporary residence permit or a request for a single permit, in Serbia.

## **Temporary residence**

As we already wrote in our newsletter published following the adoption of the amendments to the Foreigners Act, the most important novelty is the separation of the procedure for granting a temporary residence into:

- procedure for issuing a single permit (permit for temporary residence and work of a foreigner) - based on employment and professional specialization, training and practice, and
- the procedure for issuing a temporary residence permit - on all other legal grounds.

## **Single permit**

Starting from February 2024, the procedure for hiring foreigners in our country has been simplified by instituting a single administrative office (the competent Ministry of Internal Affairs - MUP), i.e. with the introducing a single permit as a card-based, biometric document allowing foreigners to stay and work. The National Employment Service (NSZ) will continue to assess the fulfillment of the conditions for employment of a foreigner, which it will then submit to the MUP, which decides on the request for a single permit.

From February 1, 2024, the request for the issuance of a single permit (requesting a temporary residence and work permit for a foreigner) may be submitted exclusively electronically through the Internet portal. According to the Regulation on Issuing a Single Permit for Temporary Residence and Work of a Foreigner[^2], the request can be submitted by a foreign citizen, an employer on behalf of a foreigner, or a third party authorized by them. The documentation that is submitted with the application for the issuance of a single permit is prescribed by the aforementioned regulation and must be submitted in the form of an original electronic document or in the form of a digitized document.

The new rules allow employers to submit **a group** request for the issuance of a single permit - for the residence and work of a larger number of people, if it is based on the same legal ground. We emphasize that, when submitting a request for the issuance of a single permit *based on employment*, the employer (or another person authorized by the employer) is obliged to initiate the procedure for the **implementation of the labor market test** before the NSZ. The request for conducting the labor market test can be submitted simultaneously with the request for a single permit, that is, no earlier than 60 days, and no later than on the day of filing the request for a single permit.

By recording the request for conducting the labor market test, a request number (ID number) is systemically generated, which is entered in the appropriate field on the request for issuing a single permit. When foreigners submit a request for a single permit on their own, the ID number is obtained from the employer.

## **Temporary residence permit**

More detailed conditions for the approval of temporary residence, the layout of the application for the approval of temporary residence and the layout of the permit form for temporary residence are prescribed by the Regulation on the Approval of Temporary Residence.[^3]

As a reminder: a temporary residence permit is a residence permit for a foreigner who intends to reside in the Republic of Serbia:

- longer than 90 days in a period of 180 days,
- longer than the period of stay specified by the international agreement, or
- longer than the period for which the long-stay visa was issued,

on the basis prescribed by law, including a foreigner who has the right to work without a single permit (in accordance with the regulations governing the employment of foreigners), and who intends to stay in the Republic of Serbia for longer than the above-mentioned time.

The request for approval of temporary residence can still be submitted in paper to the Ministry of Interior on the prescribed forms, and there is also the possibility to submit the request electronically by filling out the online request form on the Portal for Foreigners. If the request is submitted electronically, the evidence is attached in the form of an original electronic document or in the form of a digitized document. Below we highlight some of the evidence to be submitted with the request on certain grounds.

For a foreigner who submits a request **based on a special form of employment** such as based on working as an accredited foreign journalist; volunteering; an expert on project implementation in cooperation with the state authorities; realization of an audiovisual work (a foreigner who is a member of the auteur and acting crew producing an audio or visual work on the Serbian territory) and seasonal work â€“ proofs of means of support and health insurance during the planned stay are not required.

A foreigner who submits an application for approval of temporary residence **based on learning the Serbian language**, in addition to the general conditions for approval of temporary residence, is required to provide a certificate of attendance at a Serbian language course with the specified start and duration of the course and proof of the intention to study in the Republic of Serbia (proof of the initiated procedure for recognition of a foreign school document, proof of tuition payment, letter from the educational institution, etc.).

From foreigners who submit an **application based on participation in international student exchange programs**, in addition to fulfilling the general conditions, the law also requires the submission of evidence that they participated in international student exchange programs approved by the ministry responsible for education and science, while the regulation requires providing a certificate of participation in the international student exchange program, issued by the competent institution, with the specified duration of the program as proof of the justification of the request.

Although the law regulated the conditions for the approval of temporary residence based on scientific-research work or other scientific-educational activities in one, so to speak, thin article, the regulation prescribed different evidence justifying requests on those two grounds, namely:

When a foreigner submits a request **based on scientific research work**, in addition to the general conditions, as proof of justification of the request, he also submits: 1) a certificate of registration of the accredited scientific research organization in the Republic of Serbia where the foreigner performs scientific research work; 2) a contract concluded with a scientific research organization on the performance of scientific research work and execution of research activities and 3) a certificate from the institution, i.e. the legal entity where the foreigner performs scientific research work, with the start date and duration of the scientific research work.

If, on the other hand, the request is submitted **based on other scientific and educational activities**, the evidence of justification of the request will depend on the specific basis of that request:

1)	in the case of a request based on the *realization of scientific activities* - a concluded contract on the performance of scientific activities, i.e. a certificate, which states the start date and duration of scientific activities;
2)	in the case of a request based on *informal education, i.e. attending training or a course for acquiring a new occupation or profession* (e.g. pilot training, IT training academy, etc.) - a concluded contract on conducting training for the purpose of education and acquiring a new occupation and profession, in which the start date and duration of the educational activities are specified, 
3)	in the case of a request based on the *sports training of younger categories of athletes* - a concluded contract on sports training and attendance at a sports school, which states the start date and duration of the activities.

A foreigner who is granted a temporary residence **based on family reunification** with a foreigner who has been issued a single permit, is granted temporary residence until the expiration date of the single permit of the foreigner with whom family reunification is requested.
***
A temporary residence permit, i.e. a single permit, is issued in the form of a card, on a form containing personalized data on the type of permit and serves as a document proving the identity of a foreigner (besides other documents provided for in the Foreigners Act).
