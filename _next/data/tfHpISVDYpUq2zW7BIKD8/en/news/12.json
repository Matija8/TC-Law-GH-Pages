As a result thereof, in future, customs organs will be able to collect customs duties within five years from their occurrence, provided that the statutory limitation period may be interrupted by any action aimed to a debt collection, in which case the statutory limitation period starts again from the beginning. However, the absolute statutory limitation period is set forth at 10 years as of the occurrence of debt, after which expiration the enforcement of customs debt will no longer be possible.  \n","domain":null}},"__N_SSG":true}
