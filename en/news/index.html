LAW ON FOREIGNERS: WHAT AWAITS FOREIGN CITIZENS FROM 01.02.2024?\n\nThe Amendments to the Foreigners Act[^1] entered into force at the beginning of August last year, which were adopted i.a. with the objective to simplify the procedure regulating the stay of foreign citizens on the territory of the Republic of Serbia.\n\nThe implementation of a significant number of the provisions of the aforementioned statute was postponed until February 1, 2024, and a period of almost six months was allowed for adoption of regulations expected to regulate certain issues in more detail. However, even that was not enough to abide by *vacation legis* rule, so the purpose of publication of regulations was suspended in this case as well: the new regulations were only published on January 26 this year and entered into force already on February 1. Since only a few still care about constitutionality (and even less about *our* right to be acquainted with the norms that apply to *us*, we leave that debate to legal jurisprudence, and restrain to an overview of some of the novelties below. \n\n## **Foreigners subjected to the visa regime**\n\nA visa, i.e. an approval to entry, stay or transit that a foreigner obtains before entering the territory of the Republic of Serbia, was until now issued in the form of a sticker that is stamped into the foreigner's travel document, and from February 1, 2024, it will also be issued in electronic format.\n\nA long-stay visa (visa D) is an approval to enter and stay in the Republic of Serbia for a period of 90 to 180 days, and it is obtained by a foreigner who needs a visa to enter the Republic of Serbia in accordance with the visa regime and who intends to submit a request for a temporary residence permit or a request for a single permit, in Serbia.\n\n## **Temporary residence**\n\nAs we already wrote in our newsletter published following the adoption of the amendments to the Foreigners Act, the most important novelty is the separation of the procedure for granting a temporary residence into:\n\n- procedure for issuing a single permit (permit for temporary residence and work of a foreigner) - based on employment and professional specialization, training and practice, and\n- the procedure for issuing a temporary residence permit - on all other legal grounds.\n\n## **Single permit**\n\nStarting from February 2024, the procedure for hiring foreigners in our country has been simplified by instituting a single administrative office (the competent Ministry of Internal Affairs - MUP), i.e. with the introducing a single permit as a card-based, biometric document allowing foreigners to stay and work. The National Employment Service (NSZ) will continue to assess the fulfillment of the conditions for employment of a foreigner, which it will then submit to the MUP, which decides on the request for a single permit.\n\nFrom February 1, 2024, the request for the issuance of a single permit (requesting a temporary residence and work permit for a foreigner) may be submitted exclusively electronically through the Internet portal. According to the Regulation on Issuing a Single Permit for Temporary Residence and Work of a Foreigner[^2], the request can be submitted by a foreign citizen, an employer on behalf of a foreigner, or a third party authorized by them. The documentation that is submitted with the application for the issuance of a single permit is prescribed by the aforementioned regulation and must be submitted in the form of an original electronic document or in the form of a digitized document.\n\nThe new rules allow employers to submit **a group** request for the issuance of a single permit - for the residence and work of a larger number of people, if it is based on the same legal ground. We emphasize that, when submitting a request for the issuance of a single permit *based on employment*, the employer (or another person authorized by the employer) is obliged to initiate the procedure for the **implementation of the labor market test** before the NSZ. The request for conducting the labor market test can be submitted simultaneously with the request for a single permit, that is, no earlier than 60 days, and no later than on the day of filing the request for a single permit.\n\nBy recording the request for conducting the labor market test, a request number (ID number) is systemically generated, which is entered in the appropriate field on the request for issuing a single permit. When foreigners submit a request for a single permit on their own, the ID number is obtained from the employer.\n\n## **Temporary residence permit**\n\nMore detailed conditions for the approval of temporary residence, the layout of the application for the approval of temporary residence and the layout of the permit form for temporary residence are prescribed by the Regulation on the Approval of Temporary Residence.[^3]\n\nAs a reminder: a temporary residence permit is a residence permit for a foreigner who intends to reside in the Republic of Serbia:\n\n- longer than 90 days in a period of 180 days,\n- longer than the period of stay specified by the international agreement, or\n- longer than the period for which the long-stay visa was issued,\n\non the basis prescribed by law, including a foreigner who has the right to work without a single permit (in accordance with the regulations governing the employment of foreigners), and who intends to stay in the Republic of Serbia for longer than the above-mentioned time.\n\nThe request for approval of temporary residence can still be submitted in paper to the Ministry of Interior on the prescribed forms, and there is also the possibility to submit the request electronically by filling out the online request form on the Portal for Foreigners. If the request is submitted electronically, the evidence is attached in the form of an original electronic document or in the form of a digitized document. Below we highlight some of the evidence to be submitted with the request on certain grounds.\n\nFor a foreigner who submits a request **based on a special form of employment** such as based on working as an accredited foreign journalist; volunteering; an expert on project implementation in cooperation with the state authorities; realization of an audiovisual work (a foreigner who is a member of the auteur and acting crew producing an audio or visual work on the Serbian territory) and seasonal work – proofs of means of support and health insurance during the planned stay are not required.\n\nA foreigner who submits an application for approval of temporary residence **based on learning the Serbian language**, in addition to the general conditions for approval of temporary residence, is required to provide a certificate of attendance at a Serbian language course with the specified start and duration of the course and proof of the intention to study in the Republic of Serbia (proof of the initiated procedure for recognition of a foreign school document, proof of tuition payment, letter from the educational institution, etc.).\n\nFrom foreigners who submit an **application based on participation in international student exchange programs**, in addition to fulfilling the general conditions, the law also requires the submission of evidence that they participated in international student exchange programs approved by the ministry responsible for education and science, while the regulation requires providing a certificate of participation in the international student exchange program, issued by the competent institution, with the specified duration of the program as proof of the justification of the request.\n\nAlthough the law regulated the conditions for the approval of temporary residence based on scientific-research work or other scientific-educational activities in one, so to speak, thin article, the regulation prescribed different evidence justifying requests on those two grounds, namely:\n\nWhen a foreigner submits a request **based on scientific research work**, in addition to the general conditions, as proof of justification of the request, he also submits: 1) a certificate of registration of the accredited scientific research organization in the Republic of Serbia where the foreigner performs scientific research work; 2) a contract concluded with a scientific research organization on the performance of scientific research work and execution of research activities and 3) a certificate from the institution, i.e. the legal entity where the foreigner performs scientific research work, with the start date and duration of the scientific research work.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the request is submitted **based on other scientific and educational activities**, the evidence of justification of the request will depend on the specific basis of that request:\n\n1)\tin the case of a request based on the *realization of scientific activities* - a concluded contract on the performance of scientific activities, i.e. a certificate, which states the start date and duration of scientific activities;\n2)\tin the case of a request based on *informal education, i.e. attending training or a course for acquiring a new occupation or profession* (e.g. pilot training, IT training academy, etc.) - a concluded contract on conducting training for the purpose of education and acquiring a new occupation and profession, in which the start date and duration of the educational activities are specified, \n3)\tin the case of a request based on the *sports training of younger categories of athletes* - a concluded contract on sports training and attendance at a sports school, which states the start date and duration of the activities.\n\nA foreigner who is granted a temporary residence **based on family reunification** with a foreigner who has been issued a single permit, is granted temporary residence until the expiration date of the single permit of the foreigner with whom family reunification is requested.\n***\nA temporary residence permit, i.e. a single permit, is issued in the form of a card, on a form containing personalized data on the type of permit and serves as a document proving the identity of a foreigner (besides other documents provided for in the Foreigners Act).\n\n**Disclaimer**: The text is informative and does not constitute legal advice\n\n[^1]: Law on Amendments to the Law on Foreigners - \"Official Gazette of RS\" no. 62/2023 of July 27, 2023.\n[^2]: Regulation on Issuing a Single Permit for Temporary Residence and Work of a Foreigner \"Official Gazette of RS\" No. 6 /2024 of January 26, 2024.\n[^3]: Regulation on the approval of temporary residence \"Official Gazette of RS\" No. 6 /2024 of January 26, 2024.\n","domain":null},{"id":"20","md":"# THE DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSION OF THE ANNUAL REPORT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF GENDER EQUALITY IS APPROACHING\n\nWe remind **employers who have more than 50 employees and workers** of the obligation to submit an annual Report on the achievement of gender equality and to submit the Record of data on the achievement of gender equality, in accordance with the Law on Gender Equality and the Regulation on records keeping and reporting on gender equality achievement (hereinafter: the Regulation).\n\nThe term **workers** means persons engaged by the employer on the basis of contracts on temporary and occasional jobs, contractor agreements, contracts on professional development and training, and contracts on supplementary work. \n\nThe annual report on the achievement of gender equality (hereinafter: the Report) is prepared by the employer by filling in the prescribed form the data regarding the method, measures and goals in respect to the improvement of gender equality which the employer has determined in its annual plan or program.\n\n**How to make a Report**: on the prescribed form - Form no. 3 (a part of the Regulation).\n\n**Whom the Report is submitted to**: Ministry for Human and Minority Rights and Social Dialogue (hereinafter: the Ministry).\n\n**How to submit the Report**: along with the Report (Form No. 3), there is the obligation to submit the Record of data on the achievement of gender equality (hereinafter: the Record), which is also submitted on the prescribed form - Form No. 1 (a part of the Regulation).\n\nThe Report and the Record can be submitted in *written* or *electronic* form, in the Serbian language and Cyrillic alphabet (and in the Latin alphabet in accordance with the law governing the official use of language and letter).\n\n**Until when**: the deadline for submitting the Report and Record for the year 2023 is **January 15, 2024**. \n\n## As a reminder:\n\nIn accordance with the Law on Gender Equality and the Regulation, an employer in the private sector with more than 50 employees and workers **has the following obligations**:\n-\tto make an annual work plan i.e. a program that, among other things, contains a part related to the achievement and improvement of gender equality\n\nThe employer is obliged to include in its annual work plan i.e. program a part related to the realization and improvement of gender equality, which includes an overview and a brief assessment of the situation related to the position of women and men in the work environment at the employer, including age.

The exception refers exclusively to insured persons:\n\n-\tsuffering from malignant diseases,\n\n-\twho are temporarily prevented from working due to illness or complications related to maintenance of pregnancy,\n\n-\twith disabilities,\n\n-\tright after a surgical procedure, except in the case of outpatient surgery.\n\nAlso, due to irregularities in the **connecting of the days of sick leave** based on different grounds of temporary incapacity for work by chosen doctors, and abuse of sick leave by the insured persons, both in cases of intermittent and cases of continuous sick leave, the deadlines for mandatory referral of insured persons to the first instance commission of the RFZO were shortened, both in terms of the number of days of temporary incapacity for work and in terms of the period of total incapacity, i.e. the period preceding the sick leave that followed the termination of the previous sick leave.\n\n## **Request for compensation and calculation of salary compensation**\n\nIn the future, employers will not calculate salary compensation for employees who are **on sick leave for more than 30 days**, but it will be done (only) by the RFZO, after that delivered to the employer.\n\nEmployers’ obligation to submit a **request for the payment of salary compensation** to the RFZO branch with all the evidence required for payment remains, provided that the deadline for submitting the request is shortened from 30 to 15 days. Based on the employer's request, and no later than within 21 days of receiving the request with evidence, the RFZO will determine the right to and the amount of salary compensation and will complete a calculation, after which it will deliver the calculation to the employer and transfer the funds to the employer's special purpose account.\n\n## **Shorter deadlines for the fulfillment of the employer's obligations**\n\n-\tThe **deadline for submitting a request** for salary compensation has been **shortened from 30 to 15 days** as of the day of payment of salary for the month to which the compensation applies.\n\n-\tEmployers will **transfer the funds** paid by the RFZO to a special purpose account as the salary compensation to the insured person **no later than 7 days** as of the receipt of funds. If the employer fails to do so within the specified period, he is obliged to return the funds to the RFZO with the interest by which they were increased while being in the employer's special purpose account.\n\n## **Penalties**\n\nThe amendments stipulate that an employer with the capacity of a legal entity will be fined from 300,000 to 1,000,000 dinars for a misdemeanor:\n\n-\tif it does not submit a request for the payment of salary compensation with all the evidence required for payment for employees whose salary compensation is provided from the mandatory health insurance funds, as well as\n\n-\tif the salary compensation from the mandatory health insurance funds transferred to the employer's special purpose account is not paid to the insured person at the latest in seven days from the date of receipt and is not returned to the RFZO branch with the interest for which the funds were increased while they were in the employer's special purpose account.\n\nFor the same offense, the responsible person in the legal entity and other applicants will be fined from 40,000 to 50,000 dinars, while the employer - entrepreneur will be fined from 300,000 to 500,000 dinars.\n\n[^1]: Amendments to the Health Insurance Act \"Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia\" No. 92/2023 - published on October 27 and enters into force on November 4, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n","domain":null},{"id":"18","md":"# WHAT’S NEW IN THE SERBIAN NATIONAL QUALIFICATIONS FRAMEWORK\n\nAt the beginning of September 2023, the Serbian Parliament passed amendments to the Act on the National Framework of Qualifications of the Republic of Serbia (hereinafter: the **NOKS Act**) aiming to improve the efficiency of certain procedures carried out by the competent bodies, regulate specific parts of the procedure for recognizing prior learning (neglected by the initial text), as well as  to define the role of the Office for Dual Education and National Framework of Qualifications, as the Government service established to ensure the coordinated work of the Government and various state administration bodies to enhance the situation in the area of the National Framework of Qualifications and Dual Education.\n\nThe Ministry of Education, Science and Technological Development established the standards for career guidance and counseling activities already in June 2019. However, when enacting the NOKS Act, the legislator failed to prescribe the authority for monitoring the implementation of those activities. That is finally corrected by these amendments which prescribed that the implementation of career guidance and counseling activities will be monitored by the Qualifications Agency based on the annual work report to be submitted to it by the implementers of those activities, on a special form which is yet to be prescribed.\n\nAs the most important, we point out the changes which specify that NOKS levels 2, 3 and 5 can also be obtained through the *process of recognition of previous learning*, and the possibility to obtain NOKS level 5 through *training in informal adult education*. Furthermore, the provisions of the NOKS Act were harmonized with amendments to the Statute on Secondary Education in a way to establish the prerequisites of *two years of work experience* for specialist and craftsman education as well as the completed *program for passing the state two-year high school graduation* and passed *general high school graduation* for the sub-levels 6.1 and 6.2.\n\n## Review of qualifications after the amendments to the NOKS Act\n\nWe remind you that the NOKS qualifications are classified into eight (8) levels and four (4) sub-levels. For the sake of clarity, below we provide a **complete overview of qualifications after the amendments to the NOKS Act**:\n\n1. the first level (level 1) is obtained by completing basic education and upbringing, basic education for adults, basic music or basic ballet education and upbringing;\n\n1. the second level (level 2) is acquired through vocational training lasting up to one year, work-based learning lasting up to two years, i.e. informal education of adults lasting 120-360 hours of training and through the process of recognition of previous learning. The precondition for acquiring this level is obtained NOKS level 1;\t\n\n1. the third level (level 3) is obtained by completing secondary vocational education lasting three years, i.e. informal adult education lasting at least 960 hours of training and through the process of recognition of previous learning. The precondition for acquiring this level is obtained NOKS level 1;\n\n1. the fourth level (level 4) is obtained by completing a four-year secondary education (vocational, artistic, high school). The precondition for acquiring this level is obtained NOKS level 1;\n\n1. the fifth level (level 5) is acquired by completing a craftsman or specialist education lasting two or one year after obtaining NOKS level 3 or NOKS level 4.

While we keep hearing about the cheapening of transport services, the new ticketing system has lined up citizens in the lines we remember from the times of sanctions and created a number of doubts and problems for employers. In the following, we will address some of the issues that employers face from the point of view of their obligation to reimburse the cost of the employee's travel to and from work.\n\n## Rules, rules to make us...\n\nPursuant to the provision of Article 118, paragraph 1, item 1) of the Labor Code, the employee has the right to be reimbursed for the costs of travel to and from work (the so-called transportation costs), in the amount of the price of a public transportation ticket, if the employer has not provided its own transportation, in accordance with the employer’s policies and employment contract. Employees exercise this right during the time they spend at work i.e. they do not exercise it during vacation, sick leave and other cases of absence from work.\n\nThe provision of Article 18, paragraph 1, item 1) of the Personal Income Tax Statute stipulates that income tax on the employee's income based on reimbursement of transportation costs shall not be paid for *proven* transportation costs for travel to and from work - up to the price of a public transport monthly ticket, i.e. up to the amount of the actual transportation costs, but not exceeding 5.017 dinars per month, and according to  Article 9, paragraph 2 of the Accounting Statute, an accounting document is defined as a written document or electronic record of a transaction change that contains all the data required for the entry in the accounting books, so that the basis, nature and content of the transaction change can be clearly determined from the accounting document.\n\nThe employee's right to be reimbursed for transportation costs (logically) creates an obligation for the employer to reimburse him. This practically means that the employer is obliged to pay the employee the *real* cost of coming to and going from work for the time spent at work, provided that the occurrence of tax liability depends on whether such cost is documented. If it is, the expense is not taxable up to the specified maximum amount (above that it is taxed at the rate of 10%), and if it is not documented, the employer is obliged to pay tax on the entire amount paid to the employee on this basis.\n\nWhile the debate over the rightness, fairness, and appropriateness of such a solution has been ongoing since the introduction of the requirement to document these costs in 2019 (for which the Ministry of Finance has not been overly sympathetic), the new ticketing system further complicates documenting while raising questions about the legality of the PUC's \"collection of transportation costs \" operation (that issue is for another debate). \n\n## How to get - which - ticket?\n\nThe new rules stipulate: time-limited, daily, multi-day, monthly and annual tickets for the use of public transport, and from the employer's point of view, optimal solutions should be sought between time-limited, daily and monthly tickets. The choice, or more precisely the choices, depend on a number of circumstances, so the discussion of this issue here is out of place (therefore, we limit ourselves to warning employers to prepare to meet (also) this challenge when regulating transportation costs). If it decides to use a monthly ticket (as the seemingly simplest solution, i.e. usually with the least administrative burden), he must take into account, in particular, the method of calculating the transportation costs in the event that the employee does not work the whole month, in order to avoid paying, on the one hand, the amount exceeding the costs actually incurred by the employee on this basis, and, on the other hand, an amount lower than the costs actually incurred by the employee - due to the price ratio of different types of tickets.\n\nIt is envisaged that tickets will be purchased at *service centers, at points of sale, by SMS, through a special application or portal for purchasing tickets*, so currently (June 5, 2023) employees can only purchase them by SMS and (after queuing) at one of the 10 points of sale, while the other three methods are not in operation.\n\nUnlike employees, employers are allowed to purchase (exclusively) monthly tickets for their employees, provided that they register on the website of Public Utility Company \"Billing for Transportation Services Belgrade\"[^2] (hereinafter: PUC). Under this purchase option, the employer will create online a ticket purchase request and receive a preliminary invoice and, after receiving the payment, the PUC will send the employer the certificates of the purchased ticket for each employee by email and an electronic ticket by SMS to the employee.\n\n## Problems and - more problems\n\nBased on the currently available options for purchasing tickets and the tax exemption applicable only to reimbursement of proven transportation costs, some of the advantages and disadvantages are discussed below.\n\nI. **What can the employer do if the employee buys the ticket himself**\n\nIn order to ensure that the payment of transportation costs can be proven by an accounting document, employers resort to stipulating the obligation for the employees (by the internal policies or employment contract) to provide proof of the ticket purchase. Since in practice the reimbursement of transportation costs is paid to the employee at the end of the calendar month in which they were incurred, depending on the form of the ticket, the employer could stipulate as proof:\n\n1.\tfor paper tickets - **original** (one or more) **paper tickets** for the month for which the expenses are reimbursed;\n\n1.\tor electronic tickets purchased by SMS - **photocopy or scanned invoice from the mobile operator** for the previous calendar month showing the price of the electronic ticket, \n\nwhile for the *announced* methods (purchase through a special application or portal) remains to be seen when they will have been put into operation.\n\nIn both cases, when it comes to time-limited and day tickets, the employer should consider the justification of expenses for each employee and limit the maximum amount of such expenses to which the employee may exercise the right to the price of the monthly ticket.\n\nThe positive side of this solution is that it allows the employer to calculate and pay the compensation for transportation expenses only for the days when the employee actually worked, the negative side is (needless to emphasize) the non-negligible and unjustified administrative and financial burden. It is not out of place to remind once again that the employer is obliged to calculate and pay the prescribed wage tax if the employee does not provide proof in order not to be liable to prosecution.\n\nII. **What does the employer get through the direct purchase of a (monthly) ticket**\n\nAs noted above, when tickets are purchased through the website, PUC will deliver to the employer a **Certificate of Purchased Ticket** for each employee (for whom it has purchased a ticket) to the employer's email address provided at the time of registration. Such a certificate fulfills the feature of an accounting document, which is also one of the advantages of this solution, because it \"saves\" the employer time and money needed for collecting evidence from employees.\n\nFor employers with 6 or more employees who purchase tickets in this way, an additional benefit is granted in the form of a discount on the price of a monthly ticket, so that instead of the price of 2,200.00 dinars for zone A or B, or 3,300.00 dinars for zone C, a price of 2,000.00, i.e. 3,000.00 dinars (per employee) is paid.\n\nOn the other hand, this solution, as it is *currently* designed, is to be criticized from the perspective of the  personal data protection regulations, as it involves the unlawful collection and processing of employees' personal data, by requiring the employer to first submit to the PUC (at the time of registration), a table for the registration of employees containing personal data of the employees for whom it purchases monthly tickets (first name, surname, personal ID No. and telephone number), as well as the request for the issuance of transport documents and transportation tickets, and the consent to the processing of personal data for each employee, signed by the employee. Such a procedure violates the legal principles of personal data processing (the justification of collecting employee data to start with, neglect of data minimization requirement, etc.), as the PUC provides the employer with certificates with a unique ticket number that the employer could give to employees for using the public transport service. Judging from the information on the PUC's website, we fear that the company abided by personal data protection regulations *only to some extent* when setting up the new ticket collection system.\n\nAn additional drawback of this solution is the impossibility to pay the employee the *real* transportation costs for the days spent at work, since the employer must buy monthly tickets (as they are the only ones sold this way) and has to buy them in advance, which precludes the application of the basic rule according to which the right to reimbursement and obligation to compensate these costs depends on whether they occurred and in which amount they were incurred. For the employer, this again raises the question of taxation of the \"more\" expense paid for the days on which the employee did not show up for work in the calendar month for which the expense is paid.\n\n## In lieu of a conclusion\n\nReimbursement of the employee’s transportation costs is one of the most illustrative examples of the general confusion and fragmentation of the legal and institutional framework. The neglect of the purpose of the matter, the intellectual vacuity of the decision-makers, the jumble of rules, regulations, and measures designed to implement them, have led here, as in numerous other cases, to an absolute *alienation* from the essence and goal of the rule, which should serve such a simple purpose.\n\nAs with every problem, there are solutions to this one too, though they almost invariably require an unacceptably excessive expenditure of resources to address the risks posed by the current labor, tax, and \"transportation\" system that could and would be incomparably more purposeful to the economy.\n\nThose who have not already done so will rue the days of the famous \"ribbons.\"\n\n[^1]:Rulebook on Fare System in Public Passenger Transportation in the teritorry of the City of Belgrade (*“Official Journal of the City of Belgrade“* No. 30/2023 and the Pricelist regulating Fares for Transportation Services in Public Passenger Transportation in the teritorry of the City of Belgrad (*“Official Journal of the City of Belgrade“* No. 32/2023)\n[^2]:[Public Utility Company \"Billing for Transportation Services Belgrade\"](https://online.bgnaplata.rs/sr/registracija-pravnih-lica)","domain":null},{"id":"16","md":"# AMENDMENTS TO THE WASTE MANAGEMENT ACT\n\nThe following are some of the most important novelties in the Waste Management Act, in force as of May 7, 2023.\n\n### Responsibility of the waste generator\n\nIn the event of a change in technology, a change in the origin of the raw material and other activities that would affect the change in the character of the waste, the waste generator is required to obtain a waste study report. After the new changes, the report is kept for **five years**, after which the **waste generator is obliged to obtain a new waste study report**.  \n\nThe requirement for a waste generator to obtain a permit for the temporary storage of his own waste generated in the course of his main business activity in the place where the waste was generated has been abolished. On the other hand, a **waste generator who generates waste at several locations** and temporarily stores it in his central warehouse must obtain a permit for waste storage, and the warehouse must meet all the prescribed technical conditions. In this case, the waste may not be temporarily stored at the site of the generator, owner and/or other holder of the waste for more than **36 months**, after which the waste must be sent for treatment, i.e. reuse or disposal.  \n\n### Waste treatment\n\nThe term mobile waste management facility is defined in more detail. In addition to the obligation to obtain a permit, consent or document for the treatment of waste in a mobile facility in accordance with the law and other regulations, there is also an obligation to **obtain the consent of the local self-government unit** on whose territory the waste treatment is carried out in the mobile facility, with the competent authority first obtaining information on the place where the waste treatment is carried out.\n\nAnother novelty is that the treatment of hazardous waste can only be carried out in a mobile facility for the operation of which **a notice of approval for an environmental impact assessment** has been issued in accordance with a special ordinance.\n\n### Management of construction and demolition waste and sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants\n\nThe amendments to the Act require the separation of construction and demolition waste at the point of generation in order to prepare it for treatment, i.e. reuse, including the procedures of burial and backfilling and/or disposal, and the uncontrolled disposal of construction and demolition waste is prohibited.\n\nA person who collects, transports, stores, treats, or reuses or disposes of construction and demolition waste is required to **keep records of the amount and type of construction and demolition waste it manages** and to submit the data to **the Environmental Protection Agency**.\n\nThe management of sewage sludge generated by municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants and other similar wastewater treatment facilities is regulated, and the generator and owner and/or other holder is required to treat the sewage sludge in accordance with regulations and to **keep records** of the amount of sewage sludge collected, stored, treated, or disposed of, and **to report** to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n### Waste management permit and certificate of exemption from the permit requirement\n\nAuthority for issuance of waste management permits has been clarified to eliminate deficiencies observed in practice, and cases have been established where, instead of a permit, a **certificate of exemption from the permit requirement** is required. The certificate is issued for a period not **exceeding 90 days** (and it may not be reissued), in the case of:\n\n1. tests carried out to determine technical and technological treatments in order to obtain data for the purpose of implementing the procedure for the preparation of an impact assessment study and/or equipment testing;\n1. use of waste for scientific research purposes;\n1. testing that is carried out to determine the technical and technological parameters of the reuse of waste in order to obtain data for the implementation of the procedure for the preparation of an impact assessment study;\n1. disposal of one's own non-hazardous waste to the waste generator at the point of waste generation, except for waste generated by waste treatment processes.\n\nCases when neither a waste management permit nor a certificate of exemption from the permit requirement, is required are the following:\n\n1. movement of waste within the location of the waste generator;\n1. waste collection in containers or other household waste collection equipment,\n1. temporary storage of the generator's own waste.\n\nThe conditions for issuing a waste management permit have been tightened to require, in addition to the existing requirements, a **certificate of non-conviction** of entrepreneurs, shareholders or representatives of legal entities for criminal offenses against the environment.\nThe obligation of the operator to submit an application to amend the permit is required if there is a change in the type and/or quantity of waste in the permit, the qualified person responsible for the professional work in waste management, the address of the registered office, the company name, the working hours or other data related to the equipment and operation of the facility change, as well as in case of changes in the data from the waste collection and/or transport permit, changes in the waste collection equipment, waste transport vehicles, types of waste, company name, legal form, address of the registered office, etc.\n\n### Transboundary waste shipments\n\nA permit from the Ministry of Environmental Protection is required for transboundary waste shipments: \n+ **permit for import, export and transit of waste** - for transboundary movements of hazardous waste and non-hazardous waste for which the issuance of a permit is foreseen, i.e. \n+ **confirmation of the application for transboundary movement of waste** - for waste included in the list of non-hazardous waste for which a permit is not issued, and which can be issued with a validity period not exceeding one year.\n\nFor wastes with the same physical and chemical properties that are shipped in multiple shipments to the same destination through the same border crossings, the import, export, and transit of wastes shall be authorised for a period of up to **12 months**, while transboundary shipments of hazardous wastes subject to notification shall be authorised for up to **36 months**.\n\nRequiring exporters and importers to submit waste export and import data for the previous year to the Ministry by **March 31** of the current year is also mandatory.\n\n### Deadline for harmonization\n\nBoth legal entities and individuals are required to bring their activities into compliance with the provisions of this Act within one year of its entry into force, i.e. by May 7, 2024.\n","domain":null},{"id":"15","md":"# COMING SOON: CHANGES IN REGULATIONS GOVERNING RIGHTS OF FOREIGNERS\n\nBills to amend the Act on Foreigners and Foreign Nationals Employment Act which are meant to introduce a new, more flexible concept of employment of foreigners that will enable foreign nationals to obtain the rights to temporary reside and work in Serbia in a single procedure were introduced to the Parliament at the end of March 2023. We outline the key novelties below.  \n\n### Temporary residence\n\nA foreigner who intends to stay in Serbia more than 90 days within a period of 180 days, or longer than the period of stay stipulated by an international agreement, or longer than the period wherefor they obtained a visa for a long stay is obliged to file an application for approval of a temporary residence.\n\nTemporary residence can be granted up to **three years** and extended for the same period (depending on the grounds for which the temporary stay is being granted) provided that the request for extension of the temporary residence may be submitted at the earliest **three months** and no later than expiration of the temporary residence.\n\nExceptionally, the Government sets the categories, criteria, conditions for granting a temporary residence to foreigners, such as: investors in Serbia, talents, foreigners included in innovative activities, foreigners of Serbian origin, digital nomads, foreigners with high qualifications, and similar.\n\n### Single permit for temporary residence and work\n\nA foreigner who intends to stay and work in the Republic of Serbia, i.e. perform professional specialization, is obliged to submit a request for a single permit during the  time of their legal stay in Serbia. The grounds for a single permit can be employment, self-employment, or special cases of employment.\n\nThe request for issuance or extension of a single permit may be submitted personally, or by an employer on behalf of a foreigner, or their proxy, in e-form via a single portal, with the following documents:\n\n1.\ta valid passport, i.e. an ID if the person is a citizen of the country whose citizens can enter Serbia with an ID.

The decision is made in **15 days** from receipt of the proper request for a single permit, and the permit can be valid for up to **three years** but may be extended for the same period, depending on the existence of the reasons for which it was issued.\n\nForeigners may carry out jobs for which they obtained a single permit, but they also may change the basis for work, change the employer or work with two or more employers, during validity of a single permit, following the consent of the National Employment Service.\n\n### Permanent residence\n\nA foreigner who’s been residing in Serbia continuously for **three years** based on a temporary residence permit may be granted a permanent residence. The same may also be granted to a minor, if one of the parents is a citizen of Serbia or a foreigner who has been granted permanent residence; a foreigner whose origins are from Serbia or who is of Serbian origin; a foreigner who’s been residing in Serbia continuously for more than three years based on granted asylum, and another foreigner if it is in the interest of Serbia.\n\nA foreigner who is granted a permanent residence will also obtain a **foreigner ID** valid for **5 years**. \n\n### Employment of foreigners\n\nForeigners may be employed on condition that they have a long stay visa based on employment or have been approved a temporary or permanent residence and obtained a single permit. Exceptionally, certain categories of foreigners with a temporary residence permit may be entitled to work without being obliged to obtain a single permit.\n\nForeigners may be employed either based on a fixed-term employment contract or an employment contract for an indefinite time which can be terminated if the single permit is cancelled or for another reason set by employment law.","domain":null},{"id":"14","md":"# INCENTIVES IN THE FIELD OF CONTRIBUTIONS FOR MANDATORY SOCIAL INSURANCE   \n\nAt the end of 2022, the National Assembly of the Republic of Serbia amended several laws in order to improve the business environment and fight against the \"gray economy\". Here we present the incentives and novelties in the field of mandatory social insurance contributions[^1], the implementation of which began on January 1, 2023.\n\n#### Reduced contribution rate\n\nThe contribution rate for mandatory pension and disability insurance at the expense of the employer (i.e. salary) was reduced from 11% to 10% in order to reduce business costs. Thereby the total rate of these contributions was reduced from 25% to 24%.\n\n#### Incentives for employment in the form of benefits for employers from the private sector\n\nThe period of implementation of the existing benefits in the form of the right to a refund of part of the paid taxes and contributions based on the wages of newly employed persons has been extended, so employers will be able to exercise the right to this financial benefit for the period of 2023, ending on December 31, 2023.\n\nWe remind you that the employers entitled to this relief are: a legal entity, a lump-sum entrepreneur or an agricultural entrepreneur who, by establishing an employment with a newly employed person, increases the number of employees compared to the number of employees on March 31, 2014. Depending on the number of newly employed persons, the right to a refund of paid contribution ranges between 65% and 75%.\n\nThe same incentive is provided for employers from the group of micro and small legal entities, entrepreneurs, lump-sum entrepreneurs or agricultural entrepreneurs, under somewhat modified conditions. That employer has the right to a refund of 75% of paid contributions for mandatory social insurance, at the expense of the employee and at the expense of the employer, based on the salary for a newly employed person, paid as of December 31, 2023. if they establish an employment with at least two new persons, thereby increasing the number of employees by at least two compared to the number of employees they had on October 31, 2015.\n\nThe condition for using the benefits is that, before starting employment, a newly employed person was registered at the National Employment Service without interruption for at least six months, i.e. for at least three months if a person is a trainee.\n\nAn employer who uses any type of incentive for a certain person, which is regulated by the relevant law, does not have the right to obtain relief for that person in the form of a refund of part of the taxes and contributions paid.\n\n#### Contribution base for persons who pay tax through self-taxation\n\nThe law settled the issue of payment of contributions based on personal income from copyright and related rights royalties as well as the agreed compensation for the work performed, on which the tax is paid through self-taxation, which is calculated and paid by the person who earned such income, under the conditions specified by law. These persons can, in accordance with the law governing the personal income tax, decide on the method of determining the tax base by choosing:\n\n1. the recognition of standardized expenses in the amount of RSD 96,000 per quarter and payment of tax at the rate of 20% or\n1. the recognition of standardized expenses in the amount of RSD 57,900 quarterly increased by 34% of the gross income generated in the quarter and payment of tax at the rate of 10%.\n\nThe method of determining the tax base is also important for the determination of the base and the obligation to pay contributions for mandatory social insurance, so the contribution base based on the royalties i.e. agreed compensation amounts to:\n- for persons who opt for option a), the basis of contributions for pension and disability insurance for the quarter is taxable income, and\n- for persons who opt for option b), the contribution base for retirement and disability insurance for the quarter is at least three times the amount of the lowest monthly contribution base.\n\nIn both cases, the contribution base for mandatory health insurance for the quarter is at least three times the base amount of 15% of the average monthly salary in the Republic of Serbia.\n\nIf the bases of contributions for mandatory pension and disability insurance and contributions for mandatory health insurance are lower than taxable income, the basis of contributions is taxable income.\n\n[^1]: Amendments to the Statute on Contributions for Mandatory Social Insurance (\"Official Journal of RS\" No. 138/22)\n","domain":null},{"id":"13","md":"# NOVELTIES IN THE PROPERTY TAX ACT\n\nThe new 2021 brings significant changes in the Property Tax Act (further: the **Act**)[^1], starting with   delegation of jurisdiction over assessment, collection and control of inheritance, gift and property transfer taxes from the Tax administration to local government tax authorities.\n\nAmong other changes, we single out the most relevant, such as: open and alternative investment funds gained equal status as other property tax payers, the method for determination of real estate prices for a purpose of establishing a tax base is more precise, items of taxation are extended to entail accessory structures which are defined more closely; digital property became subject to property transfer tax when it is inherited or donated. Also, the Act set an additional condition for a tax credit as well as for tax exemption in case of a purchase of the first apartment.\n\nFor the purpose of equal tax treatment, **open and alternative investment funds which do not have properties of an entity** will be subjected to taxation with a property tax in cases they experience an incident where the taxpayers - individuals and legal entities - are subjected to taxation. \n\n**Accessory structures** became items subjected to taxation and, for the purpose of establishing a tax base, were classified in the same group of real estate property as garages, while other groups remained unchanged. This change is justified by seeking to burden taxpayers more fairly whereas accessory structures, regardless of their accessory nature, may individually represent a taxpayer’s valuable asset and increase their economic power. When announced, this change was received in public with great discontent (and probably a justified one).  However, whether it will provide fairer taxation, and to what extent, remains to be seen in practice.\n\nWith a goal to eliminate loopholes and inconsistent practices of tax authorities when determining the property tax base, the legislator defined real estate groups more precisely and defined accessory structures.\n\nAccessory structures are classified in three groups:\n\n1. Accessory structures which are not buildings (wells, swimming pools, reservoirs, tanks etc.) and accessory buildings (ground floor buildings and buildings with below-ground floor surface) which are in function of residential and business structures built on the same land (boiler-rooms, basements, sheds, etc.);\n1. Economic facilities;\n1. Eaves surfacing over 10sqm which are independent structures.\n\nIn this regard, the Act set forth the obligation for all taxpayers who do not keep books to file tax returns for real estate which is, according to the new classification, classified in a group different than before, by January 31, 2021, unless such information is already a part of their previous tax return.\n\nThe manner for assessment of the property tax base of real estate for taxpayers who keep books is specified and, i.a. set forth the following:\n\n- When the taxation item is a structure without land on which it is built (e.g. land up to 10 acres) - the tax base is the value of the structure.\n- For structures containing production lines in the processing industry - the tax base is the real estate book value, on condition that they are used for that (not any other) activity.\n- When, during the tax year, the taxpayer endures a tax obligation for a production line, storage facility and other structures set by the Act, with the adjoining land, and if the taxpayer did not separately express purchasing values of land and structures in books – the tax base for that year will be the construction value of the structure and adjoining land determined by a certified appraiser on the day the tax obligation occurred;\n- Infrastructural facilities, for which the tax base is always set in accordance with their book value do not include buildings and other structural engineering constructions;\n- Book value represents the property tax base also in cases when there were no transactions of real estate in appropriate zones and border zones, which is the reason why an assessed value could not be established.\n\nOne of the most significant novelties is that the legislator finally levied inheritance and gift tax against **digital property**, which appears to be a contemporary subject of transactions generating considerable worth. \n\nFollowing recent amendments, individuals will be able to exercise the right to **tax credit**, if they meet one additional condition to those that already exist.

The Decree enters into force on May 28, 2022, and key novelties affecting the private sector and the economy are:\n\nThresholds for the annual primary energy consumption based on which companies become EMS Reporting Entities, have been significantly decreased, so that the annual consumption threshold on at least one location in the **production sector** has been decreased from 29,08 GWh to **25 GWh**, and in the **trade and services sector** from 11,63 GWh to **7 GWh**.\n\n**The annual goal of energy saving** for companies - EMS Reporting Entities for the current calendar year is to save at each location **1% of primary energy** consumed at the location in the previous calendar year per unit of product in production activities, that is, with the obligation to normalize heat consumption in the trade and services sector, provided that the vehicles energy consumption is excluded from the annual target. Companies which already have the status of the EMS Reporting Entity[^1]  are obliged to determine the annual energy saving target in accordance with the Decree starting from January 1, 2023, whereas new Reporting Entities pursuant to the Decree will have that obligation starting from the calendar year following the year in which they acquired that status.\nCompanies - EMS Reporting Entities are obligated to submit to the Ministry in charge of energy the **Application for acquiring the EMS Reporting Entity status** on a prescribed form, **within 60 days from the entry into force of the Decree** - if they acquired that status based on the Decree, that is, after the expiration of the first calendar year in which a company achieved the annual energy consumption above the threshold set by the Decree.\n\nAnother novelty is **the obligation of EMS Reporting Entities to make an internal act** whereby they will regulate the structure of designated and responsible persons for the realization of energy management goals, as well as responsibilities, coordination, and procedures for energy consumption management.

Thereby, the LLCs are leveled with joint–stock companies (JSC) regarding the possibility to stimulate employees, investors, etc., in which a similar instrument – a share option – i.e. the employee (consultant, investor, etc.) right to purchase stocks of the JSC for a fixed price at a certain moment in future, already exists.\n\n#### Reserved Own Share\n\nReserved own share is a new institute in the Serbian law, which enables LLC to become the owner of a share by acquiring it free of charge from the company’s shareholder/s based on the decision of the company’s general meeting, in order to award the financial instrument – the right to a share option.\n\nLLC can acquire a reserved own share exclusively from those shareholders who voted for the aforementioned decision and who fully contributed i.e. paid-in their contribution in LLC.\n\nThe Act prescribed that the LLC may have one or more reserved own shares provided that the maximum percentage of participation of all reserved own shares in the company’s share capital will not exceed 40%.  \n\nThe reserved own share cannot be pledged or disposed of except as set forth by law. Furthermore, this type of share will not carry any voting rights and it will not be counted in the quorum for the general meeting, neither it will entitle the LLC to a dividend. \n\n#### Financial Instrument \nThe right to a share option is a new financial instrument in our legal system which grants the right to its concordant holder to acquire a share in LLC on a predetermined calendar date (exercise date) at the fixed agreed upon price from assets created through the reserved own share. This financial instrument is not transferable, and it cannot be pledged or inherited. \n\nOn principle, the decision to grant the financial instrument – share option (hereinafter referred to as: ISO) will be made by the general meeting of the company, and the company is obligated to submit it to the Central securities depositary and clearing house (herein: CSDCH) in the prescribed term for the purpose of enrollment and registration of ISO on behalf of their legitimate holders.     \n\nAll releases of ISO from the same reserved own share have the same exercise and payment dates, while all ISOs of the same release give their holders the same rights regarding: a share ratio they can acquire in respect to the reserved own share, price and payment term, grant date, exercise date and conditions under which it may be canceled before the exercise date. \n\n#### Acquisition of Share and Annulment of ISO  \n\nISO may be either exercised or annulled. If the holder of ISO paid the price in the amount and in term set in the decision to grant ISO(s), i.e. in the term prescribed for specific cases which will be discussed later, it will be deemed that the holder consented to the acquisition of share, i.e. that they exercised the option.\n\nAcquisition of share based upon ISO will be concurrently registered in CSDCH in respect to all ISOs issued from the same reserved own share, while the shareholders will not be able to exercise their pre-emptive rights in case of share purchase based on this ground.\n\nUpon registration of the share based on ISOs that were issued from the same reserved own share, the remaining unused part of that reserved own share may be either cancelled or used further for the issuance of new options, i.e. ISOs.\nIn case the holder of ISO does not pay the price in the above-described term, ISO will be annulled.\n\nThe company is obligated to submit a request to delete ISO based upon acquisition or cancellation of the share to the CSDCH in 30 days upon expiration of the payment term set in the decision to issue ISO for all emissions issued based on the same reserved own share, and CSDCH will deliver a confirmation on deletion upon deleting ISO from CSDCH. \n\n#### Special Cases \n\nThe Act prescribed separate rules for dissolution, fundamental changes and change of the legal form, in which cases ISO will become due before the exercise date under prescribed conditions and in set terms, and also stipulated that registration of acquisition of share based on ISO i.e. registration of decrease of share capital as a result of annulment of an unused reserved own share would be the preconditions for the decision on dissolution, fundamental changes or change of the legal form of a company.\n\n#### Protection of Rights\n\nHolders of ISO who paid the price within the exercise date, and in respect to whom the LLC failed to register acquisition of share in the prescribed term, may file a lawsuit to request their membership and share percentage to be determined by court, or to be compensated by the LLC on the grounds of ISO. Such compensation will be set by the court as the share market value which the holder of ISO would be entitled to on the exercise date.\n\nIn case of forced dissolution, ISO will cease to exist on the day of deletion of the LLC from the Registry as a result of closure of that proceeding and will be deleted from CSDCH upon law while their holders will become the company’s creditors.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nBecause of its flexible attributes, the LLC is the most common form of small and middle-size businesses and the basis of development of the Serbian as well as economies within the EU. However, despite their dominant contribution in the BDP in these economies, even the EU has only recently recognized the necessity to adapt regulations to dynamic economy growth and capital market development, both with the goal to overcome restraints for improvement which this form of business has been facing as well as to stimulate economic development.\n\nThe financial instrument – right to a share option is especially fit for companies which have the potential to achieve significant economic growth in the short period following their incorporation. Therefore, the Serbian legislator identified new IT companies which are, by rule, not able to offer conditions to their employees and consultants that other, already established, businesses can, as chief users of this instrument.\n\nIt is expected that this modernization of rules of the company law will help in overcoming that obstacle and that it will provide startup companies a chance to attract highly qualified experts interested to invest a cash capital along their work, under preferential conditions, and therewith become more dedicated to their fast, continuous and long-term development. \n","domain":null},{"id":"7","md":"# COVID-19 –   New Obligations for Employers regarding Prevention and Spreading of the Contagious Disease (July 2020)\n\nSerbia brought new preventive measures which employers are obligated to implement in order to prevent occurrence and spreading of an infectious disease and elimination of risk to safe and healthy work of their employees and persons who find themselves in the employer’s work environment, in the event an infectious disease epidemic has been proclaimed. \nThese measures shall not be implemented in cases of field and remote work.  \n\n### Temporary measures plan \n\nWith the aim to prevent occurrence and spreading of transmissible disease epidemic, employers are obligated to bring a temporary measures plan (herein: the Plan) which is an integral part of the Risk assessment act made in accordance with safety and health regulations. \n\nEmployers are obligated to bring the Plan at the latest by August 10, 2020, and it must contain:\n#####\tPreventive measures and activities for prevention of transmissible disease epidemic (hereinafter: epidemic), and especially: \n\n1.\tto provide, before commencement of work, written instructions and guidelines on measures and procedures for prevention of epidemic, which has to contain information about symptoms of the disease; \n2.\tin accordance with their capacities, to rearrange work hours through inducing the afternoon and nights shifts with lower number of employees, if they do not already have shift work;\n3.\tto effect intensified hygiene and disinfection of work and auxiliary areas, which includes regular disinfection of premises and frequent ventilation of work space;\n4.\tto provide employees with sufficient quantities of soap, paper towels, tap water and alcoholic disinfectants for washing hands;\n5.\tto provide regular cleaning of all surfaces that are frequently touched in offices, especially toilets, door handles, phones, computer equipment and other work equipment;\n6.\tto regulate a manner of recording of disinfection of work and auxiliary premises which the employer organizes and performs;\n7.\tto provide making of the instructions for safe and healthy work with contractors, suppliers, distributors and external cooperants;\n8.\tto organize and provide regular garbage and other waste removal from premises (waste bins have to be coated with plastic bags) so they can be cleared out without contact with their content.\n\n#####\tMeasures and activities for dealing in case of transmissible disease epidemic \n\nIn the event employees catch an infective disease, employers are obligated to implement preventive measures, and especially:\n\n1)\tregular physical and chemical disinfection and ventilation of the area in which an infected employee was staying;\n2)\tabiding by procedures for entering and exiting employer’s premises, use of personal protective equipment and means and adhering to other protective measures during the work process;\n3)\tto precisely define directions for movement of employees through work and auxiliary premises;\n4)\tto organize strict control of movement of employees from the organizational unit in which an infected employee has been working;\n5)\tto provide that contacts between employees working in the same unit as an infected employee and other employees be reduced to unavoidable, subject to implementation of protective measures;\n6)\tto implement all other measures recommended by epidemiologists.\n\n#####\tDuty to carry out and control implementation of preventive measures and activities\n\nThe Plan has to regulate obligations and responsibilities related to the pursuance and control of implementation of measures for safety and health at work.

Thereby it became possible to protect signs which may be represented in any other appropriate form i.e. by use of generally available technology which will enable registration of sound trademarks, trademarks consisting of motion pictures and multimedia trademark as the combination thereof. Another difference is that - besides in words, letters, numbers, colors, three-dimensional forms, combination of those signs and sounds - the sign may also **consist of the shape of goods or of the packaging of goods.** \n\nAlong with the existing grounds for refusal of protection, the Act contains **new absolute grounds for refusal** targeted to **prevent unauthorized registration of geographical indications and earlier plant variety denomination.** Regulation of collective trademarks and guarantee marks is conformed with the rules applying to them within the EU and the Act prescribed a duty for their applicants i.e. proprietors to submit any change to the regulations governing the collective mark, i.e. guarantee mark. \n\nAnother interesting change which may prevent protection is the possibility for a company registered in the company register before the date of application for protection of trademark, i.e. before the date of priority to oppose the registration. Conditions therefor are that the sign in application is identical to the name of the previously registered **company name** or its essential part, as well as that the applied goods or services are the same or alike to the company’s registered activity. Besides, a trademark shall not be registered where an **agent or representative** of the proprietor of the trademark applies for registration of that trademark in his own name without proprietor’s authorization, unless they can justify such action.\n  \t\nAs regard to procedural changes, we highlight the abandoning of appellate proceedings, so that the decisions of SIPO will be final and can be disputed only in the administrative dispute.\n\nAfter the preamble of the Directive 2015/2436/EU which emphasized the need to ensure legal certainty concerning the scope of trademark rights and to facilitate access to trademark protection and the requirement for designation and classification of goods and services covered by the trademark to be sufficiently clear and precise, the Act practically took over formulation governing designation and classification of goods and services from the directive. Accordingly, **for the purpose of trademark protection, goods and services will be designated and classified** in compliance with the Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks and will be identified with sufficient clarity and precision to enable determining the extent of the sought protection. Furthermore, the use of general terms, including general indications of the class headings shall be interpreted in a manner to include only those goods or services clearly covered by the literal meaning of the indication or term. \n\nThe Act prescribed which date will be deemed the **date of registration of the international trademark** for purposes of proving the use of international trademark in cases of invalidation, revocation due to non-use and infringement, as a result of the necessity to conform calculation of terms relevant for proving of use of national trademarks on the one hand and international trademarks on the other, taking into account specifics of the procedure for registration of international trademark. \n\nAmong provisions governing content, acquisition and extent of protection acquired through the registration of trademark, **prohibitions available to the proprietor of the trademark are expanded** to include offering of services under the mark (previously related only to goods), the right to prohibit trans-shipment in addition to importation and exportation, storage or transit of goods under the protected sign regardless of whether the goods are intended for domestic market, as well as the right to prohibit preparatory acts in relation to the use of trademark on the market (such as: use of packaging, stickers, or other means with the sign identical or similar to the proprietor’s mark), all in order to enhance trademark protection and combat counterfeiting more effectively. The proprietor is also entitled to prohibit a third party to use a sign in comparative advertising when such advertising is contrary to regulations.   \n\nThe greatest controversy has been raised by the new regulation of **exhaustion of the rights conferred by a trademark.** The former system of national exhaustion is now replaced by the international exhaustion regime.  This means that in the future, the proprietor will not be able to prohibit the use of trademark in relation to goods i.e. services which he put on the market anywhere in the world, while the exhaustion was previously restricted to the goods and services the proprietor (or a person authorized by him) put on the national market, under the protected mark. The lawmaker justified this drastic turn through the need to protect the free market, competition and consumers’ interests, completely neglecting economic value and function of trademarks. While defending of the free market, fair competition and protecting consumer interests is praiseworthy, the new regime seems to be rather a result of reckless, i.e. hasty “copy-paste” without understanding the goal of the covenant which served as the source of “inspiration”. Namely, the regional exhaustion of the rights conferred by the trademark in EU is in perfect and obvious harmony with the nature and rules of the community. In Serbia however, under the excuse of prevention of “absolute” control of the proprietor i.e. distributors over the sale of products, the lawmaker chose to widely open the door for uncontrollable parallel importation which threatens to incite unfair commercial exploitation by free riders and adverse effect to good will businesses, both economic and reputational, and most probably increase confusion and deception of consumers. Being that the international exhaustion discourages investments, does not recognize commercial significance and role of trademarks in enhancing competition and consumers’ protection, it remains to be seen whether the news regime will survive. \n\nNext to already existing **limitations of the proprietor’s rights**, the Act specified the new one stating he will not be entitled to prohibit the use of an earlier right relating only to a certain locality if such right is recognized through regulations and exercised within the boundaries of locality wherefore it was granted. \n\nIn respect to a **declaration of trademark invalidity**, the Act i.a. set for the that the proprietor of an earlier trademark cannot request invalidation of the later trademark if trademarks coexisted and he was aware of the use of the later trademark but has not opposed it for five continuous years, except if the application of a later trademark was unconscionable. Vice versa, the proprietor of the later trademark will also not be able to prohibit the use of the earlier trademark even though that earlier right may no longer be invoked against the later trademark. Cases in which the trademark will not be declared invalid are: a) if before filing of the application for invalidity a later trademark acquired distinctiveness through use and b) if the proprietor of the earlier trademark explicitly consented to registration of the later one. \n\nThe rule concerning the effective date in case of revocation due to **absence of genuine** use is changed and is now the date of application for revocation. This ties up the effect of the absence of use of the protected sign to the request directed to revocation and consequently to revocation instead of the registration date (as was prescribed before) which date can be far in the past causing unjustifiable expansion of revocation consequence to the period preceding the request. \n\nIf you are interested to read more on this subject, please sign up for our Newsletter. \n\n[^1]: **Trademark Act** („Official Journal of the Republic of Serbia“ no. 6/2020)\n[^2]: **Directive 2004/48/EC** of the EU Parliament and the Council - 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights\n[^3]: **Directive 2015/2436/EU** of the EU Parliament and of the Council - December 16, 2015 to approximate the laws of the Member States to trade marks \n[^4]: **Trademark Act** („Official Journal of the Republic of Serbia ” no. 104/09, 10/13 and 44/18 – another statute)","domain":null},{"id":"2","md":"COVID-19 – Decree on deadlines in court proceedings during the state of emergency proclaimed on March 15, 2020 (March 2020)\n\nThe decree sets forth that, during the state of emergency proclaimed on March 15, 2020, the following prescribed periods cease:\n• for filing a lawsuit in civil proceedings, private suits in criminal proceedings, non-contentious propositions, enforcement or securities procedures, lawsuit in administrative disputes and constitutional appeal;\n• for filing legal remedies, instruments or undertaking other procedural actions in the proceedings from previous bullet;\n• in criminal and misdemeanor proceedings and commercial offences, the deadlines for filing appeals against decisions whereby these proceedings are finalized, as well as for filing extraordinary legal remedies.\n","domain":null},{"id":"1","md":"New Trademark Act\n\nAs of February 1, 2020, a new Trademark Act (hereinafter: the Act)1 is in force in Serbia. The Act was adopted primarily due to the need to harmonize trademark protection with the Directive 2004/48/EC2 and Directive 2015/2436/EU3 and achieve a greater compatibility with trademark regulations with the EU member countries, as well as to establish a more efficient system of trademark protection. Because of numerous changes as regards the previous statute, we will limit this review to the most important ones.\n\nAmong key novelties, we single out adoption of opposition proceedings as a new part of the trademark registration system, which now exists along with the official examination procedure. The opposition proceedings as known in the EU did not exist in the Serbian earlier trademark law although it’s been a part of the registration system in the majority of European countries for years, and is also applied to a so-called European trademark valid on the EU territory, i.e. its member states.
